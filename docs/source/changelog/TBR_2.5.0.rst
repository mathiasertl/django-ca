  with the ``--ocsp-key-backend`` option for :command:`manage.py init_ca` and :command:`manage.py edit_ca`.
* :command:`manage.py regenerate_ocsp_keys` will not stop generating keys if Celery is *not* enabled and an
  error occurs when generating one key.
* Fix validation for ACMEv2 DNS challenges.
