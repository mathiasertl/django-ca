Quickstart with docker-compose
##############################

.. _docker-compose:

This guide provides instructions for running your own certificate authority using docker-compose. This is the
quickest and easiest way to run django-ca, especially if you do not care to much about custom configuration or
extending django-ca.

This tutorial will give you a CA with

* A root and intermediate CA.
* A browsable admin interface, protected by TLS (using Let's Encrypt certificates).
* Certificate revocation using CRLs and OCSP.
* (Optional) ACMEv2 support (= get certificates using certbot).

Required software
=================

To run **django-ca**, you need Docker and Docker Compose. You also need certbot to acquire Let's Encrypt
certificates for the admin interface. OpenSSL is used to generate the DH parameter file. On Debian/Ubuntu,
simply do:

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~$ sudo apt update
   user@host:~$ sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose certbot openssl

For a different OS, please read `Install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_, `Install
docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ and `Get certbot
<https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html>`_.

.. include:: include/docker-regular-user.rst

************************
Get initial certificates
************************

Use certbot to acquire initial certificates. This must be done `before` you run docker-compose, as both bind
to port 80 (HTTP).

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d ca.example.com
   ...
   user@host:~$ sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/ca.example.com
   README  cert.pem  chain.pem  fullchain.pem  privkey.pem

.. _docker-compose.yml:

*****************
Get configuration
*****************

.. WARNING::

   **Upgrading from before django-ca 1.19?** Please see the :ref:`update notes <update_119>` before
   proceeding.

   Note that the files for older versions in the documentation for 1.19 or later have already been updated.

Docker-compose needs a configuration file, :download:`docker-compose.yml </_files/docker-compose.yml>`. You
can also download the file for other versions `from github
<https://github.com/mathiasertl/django-ca/blob/master/docker-compose.yml>`_.

.. NOTE::

   Because of how docker-compose works, it is better to put the file in a sub-directory and `not` directly into
   your home directory. We assume you put all files into ``~/ca/`` from now on.

You can also get versions for specific versions of **django-ca** from the table below, which also shows
bundled third-party Docker images.

====================================================== ===== =========== =====

:download:`1.17.3 </_files/1.17.3/docker-compose.yml>` 6     12          1.18
====================================================== ===== =========== =====

Add ``docker-compose.override.yml``
===================================

The default :file:`docker-compose.yml` does not offer HTTPS, because too many details (cert location, etc.)
are different from system to system. We need to add a `docker-compose override file
<https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/>`_ to open the port and map the directories with the certificates
into the container.  Simply add a file called :file:`docker-compose.override.yml` next to your main
configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: docker-compose.override.yml

   version: "3.6"
   services:
       webserver:
           volumes:
               - /etc/letsencrypt/live/${DJANGO_CA_CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME}:/etc/certs/live/${DJANGO_CA_CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME}/
               - /etc/letsencrypt/archive/${DJANGO_CA_CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME}:/etc/certs/archive/${DJANGO_CA_CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME}/
               - ${PWD}/dhparam.pem:/etc/nginx/dhparams/dhparam.pem
               - ${PWD}/acme/:/usr/share/django-ca/acme/
           ports:
               - 443:443

This will work if you get your certificates using ``certbot`` or a similar client. If your private key in
public key chain is named different, you can set ``NGINX_PRIVATE_KEY`` and ``NGINX_PUBLIC_KEY`` in your
:file:`.env` file below.

Add ``.env`` file
=================

Some settings in **django-ca** can be configured with environment variables (except where a more complex
structure is required). Simply create a file called :file:`.env` next to :file:`docker-compose.yaml`.

For a quick start, there are only a few variables you need to specify:

.. code-block:: bash

   # The hostname for your CA.
   # WARNING: Changing this requires new CAs (because the hostname goes into the certificates).
   DJANGO_CA_CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=ca.example.com

   # Enable ACMEv2 support
   DJANGO_CA_CA_ENABLE_ACME=true

   # PostgreSQL superuser password (required by the Docker image), see also:
   #   https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
   #
   # Generate a secure password e.g. with "openssl rand -base64 32"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword

   # NGINX TLS configuration
   NGINX_TEMPLATE=tls
   NGINX_PRIVATE_KEY=/etc/certs/live/ca.example.com/privkey.pem
   NGINX_PUBLIC_KEY=/etc/certs/live/ca.example.com/fullchain.pem

Generate DH parameters
======================

The TLS configuration also requires that you generate a DH parameter file, used by some TLS ciphers. You can
generate it with:

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~/ca/$ openssl dhparam -dsaparam -out dhparam.pem 4096

Customization
=============

Although the defaults are fine for most scenarios, **django-ca** and Django itself support a wide range of
settings to customize your installation. Django has its settings documented under `Settings
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/>`_, django-ca settings are documented under :doc:`custom
settings <settings>`.

Just like when using the plain Docker container, you can configure django-ca using either environment
variables (set in e.g. ``docker-compose.override.yml``) or using an extra YAML configuration file. For more
details on how to configure the Docker container, refer to :ref:`docker-configuration`.

.. NOTE::

   In our docker-compose setup, django-ca is used in both the ``backend`` and ``frontend`` containers. Make
   sure you configure both of them.


Configuration using a YAML configuration file
---------------------------------------------

Using an extra configuration file is the most flexible way to configure django-ca, as it allows you to update
even complex settings. It has the added advantage that docker-compose will not recreate the containers if you
update the configuration.

As with the normal docker container, django-ca will read configuration files in ``/usr/src/django-ca/ca/conf/``
in alphabetical order, but it will also read files in the subfolder ``/usr/src/django-ca/conf/ca/compose/``, which
provides configuration specific to our docker-compose setup.

To add a configuration file, first add a volume mapping in your ``docker-compose.override.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: docker-compose.override.yml

   version: "3.6"
   services:
       backend:
           volumes:
               - ./localsettings.yaml:/usr/src/django-ca/ca/conf/compose/99-localsettings.yaml
       frontend:
           volumes:
               - ./localsettings.yaml:/usr/src/django-ca/ca/conf/compose/99-localsettings.yaml
       webserver:
           # same as before...

... and then simply add a file called ``localsettings.yaml`` in your current directory, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: localsettings.yaml

   # Set a custom cache.
   #
   # NOTE: docker-compose uses a Redis cache, this here just serves as an example.
   #
   # See also:
   #     https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#std:setting-CACHES
   CACHES:
      default:
         BACKEND: django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache


Configuration using environment variables
-----------------------------------------

If you want to use environment variables for configuration, we recommend you first add them to your
``docker-compose.override.yml``, for example to `configure a different SMTP server
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#email-host>`_ for sending out emails:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: docker-compose.override.yml

   version: "3.6"
   services:
       backend:
           environment:
               DJANGO_CA_EMAIL_HOST:
       frontend:
           environment:
               DJANGO_CA_EMAIL_HOST:
       webserver:
           # same as before...

and in your ``.env`` file, set the variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   DJANGO_CA_EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com


Recap
=====

By now, you should have four files in ``~/ca/``:

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~/ca/$ ls -A
   docker-compose.yml docker-compose.override.yml .env dhparam.pem

*************
Start your CA
*************

Now, you can start **django-ca** for the first time. Inside the folder with all your configuration, run
docker-compose (and verify that everything is running):

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~/ca/$ docker-compose up -d
   ...
   Creating django-ca_backend_1  ... done
   Creating django-ca_webserver_1 ... done
   user@host:~/ca/$ docker-compose ps
   Name                       Command               State         Ports
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   django-ca_backend_1     ./celery.sh -l info              Up
   django-ca_cache_1       docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up
   django-ca_db_1          docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up
   django-ca_frontend_1    /bin/sh -c ./uwsgi.sh            Up
   django-ca_webserver_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh /bin ...   Up    0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp,...

By now, you should be able to see the admin interface (but not log in yet - you haven't created a user yet).
Simply go to https://ca.example.com/admin/.

Create admin user and set up CAs
================================

Inside the backend container, ``manage`` is an alias for ``manage.py``.

.. WARNING:: 

   **Updating from django-ca 1.18.0 or earlier?** Please see :ref:`update_119`.

In general, updating django-ca is done by getting the :ref:`latest version of docker-compose.yml 
<docker-compose.yml>` and then simply recreating the containers:

.. code-block:: console

   user@host:~/ca/$ curl -O https://.../docker-compose.yml
   user@host:~/ca/$ docker-compose up -d
