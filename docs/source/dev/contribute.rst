**********************
Initialize environment
**********************

To create a virtual environment for development, you need a compatible Python version as well as a few
development headers. Under Debian/Ubuntu, you can install everything with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ apt install python3 build-essential pkg-config \
   >     postgresql-client libpq-dev mariadb-client libmariadb-dev

Virtual environment
===================

To create and activate a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ uv sync --all-extras
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   (venv) $

Local configuration
===================

To run the Djangos integrated development web server, create some minimal local configuration as YAML file:

.. code-block:: YAML

    DEBUG: true
    SECRET_KEY: dummy
    ALLOWED_HOSTS:
      - localhost

    # django-ca configuration
    CA_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME: "localhost:8000"
    CA_ENABLE_ACME: true
    CA_ENABLE_REST_API: true

    # Set to true if you want to use Celery
    CA_USE_CELERY: false

Initialize demo
===============

You can *optionally* initialize the demo, which will generate several certificate authorities and
certificates:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./dev.py init-demo

Run local web server
====================

If you need to run the local web server (to test the API, OCSP or CRL URLs or the admin interface):

.. code-block:: console

   $ python ca/manage.py runserver
